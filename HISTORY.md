## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial `Medication Tracker.html` and `index.html` standalone iOS-optimized web app for tracking scheduled doses, Medrol dose pack days, and as-needed (PRN) medications.
- Offline Progressive Web App support via `manifest.json`, `sw.js` Service Worker, and custom home screen icons (`icon-180.png`, `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`).
- Shareable iPhone launcher files (`Install Med Tracker Home Screen Icon.mobileconfig`, `Open Medication Tracker.webloc`, `Open Medication Tracker.url`, and `Medication Tracker QR Code.png`).
- `chat_summary.html` documenting the iPhone web app troubleshooting and deployment workflow.
- Password lock screen (`SHA-256` verification with persistent `localStorage` unlock state) on `index.html` and `Medication Tracker.html`.

### Changed
- Enhanced `Medication Tracker.html` with automatic local file preview detection to break out of iOS Quick Look into Safari and preserve `localStorage` state.
- Updated `sw.js` Service Worker to ignore non-200 responses, ensuring the installed iPhone Home Screen app continues working offline even after the GitHub repository is made private.
- Removed dosage mass (mg) from medication titles and added short purpose labels next to each medication name in `index.html` and `Medication Tracker.html`.
- Color-coded medication `[purpose]` labels (yellow for non-food scheduled meds, orange for take-with-food meds, red for as-needed PRN meds) and compacted vertical spacing across `index.html` and `Medication Tracker.html`.
- Moved the `As needed` section to the top of the page and slated logged as-needed doses (plus their next 6-hour eligible follow-up slot) chronologically into the daily schedule.
